Hello! My name is Jacob Allebach and I am a computer scientist. I am currently a student at Allegheny College and am expected to graduate in the Spring of 2024. I am a big fan of video games and video game development and hope to finish my first complete game within 2023. This website is to serve as a base for my research findings while completing my degree.
