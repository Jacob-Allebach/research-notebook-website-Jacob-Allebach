My main area of research for my senior project at Allegheny College is in the realm of video game development. I take a great interest in video games and the process of creating them as I enjoy the creative process of coming up with characters and gameplay ideas. Though I am interested in video game development as a whole, my particular area of intrigue for research is in the Roguelike and fighting game genres. Roguelike games can be described as those that have some elements of randomness and allow for multiple playthroughs that can provide different experiences. Many parts of Roguelikes can be randomly generated, such as the maps for the areas you are in, the enemies that can appear, and the items that you are allowed to pick up. Although there is some debate as to the terminology between Roguelikes and Rogue-lites, I think that the former is descriptive enough to clearly state my area of interest. The randomness in video games and ways to make it interesting and fun to play over and over motivates my research quite a bit. The other area that I take some interest in is with fighting games, namely traditional 2D fighting games like Street Fighter and Guilty Gear. The way that the engines work to allow for each different interaction between the characters is fascinating to me, and potentially creating a system that would make that process easier could be another idea for my senior projectâ€™s research. Though these are my specific interests, I still enjoy researching and discussing video games as a whole, so my options are not exclusive to those areas, though they would be preferred.
