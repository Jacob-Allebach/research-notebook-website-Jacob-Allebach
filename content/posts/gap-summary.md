The gap in research between my project and what has been done is mainly within the realm of actually creating a tool that can utilize the different generation methods that have been researched before. In order to do that, it’s important to understand how the maps are actually generated to begin with, but it’s also relevant to know the more specific types of generations and methods of creating maps to begin with. This gap is very prevalent and definitely exists because from my research, there isn’t a tool that can be used to randomly generate maps in this fashion. Despite there being a large amount of research on dungeon map generation in video games as a whole, I have been completely unable to find a tool that assists someone in generating maps that are actually usable, and I think that it would be an extremely useful tool for many developers of roguelike games. In order to actually create my tool, I’m going to need to get much more familiar with the systems of Unity, as I think that is where I would like to create my tool. I’m honestly very excited to work on this project since I refined my idea into what it is now because I truly believe that this tool could be extremely practical and useful for game developers everywhere, and at the very least I think it will be cool.
