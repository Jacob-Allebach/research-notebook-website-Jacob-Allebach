## [A Logical Approach to Building Dungeons: Answer Set Programming for Hierarchical Procedural Content Generation in Roguelike Games](http://doc.gold.ac.uk/aisb50/AISB50-S02/AISB50-S2-Smith-paper.pdf)

This article discusses the use of Answer Set Programming (ASP) in the process of Procedural Content Generation (PCG) for video games. The overall goal of this article is to prove the practicality of ASP for more complex game environments without sacrificing too much performance in exchange for scalability. Some amount of motivation for this research is to show that itâ€™s useful for things like roguelike games and the design space involving those. It uses several different types of maps, such as puzzle levels and dungeon layouts, to generate levels and test the ASP system they created. Their findings are that ASP is extremely effective for map generation, but can be very costly in terms of time if one takes a naive approach, which can be seen from the data they collected while testing the system. This should prove very effective for my research as it directly relates to map generation for the roguelike game genre.
