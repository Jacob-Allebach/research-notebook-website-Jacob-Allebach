## [Two-step Constructive Approaches for Dungeon Generation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3337722.3341847)

This article is about generating dungeon layouts using a two-step process and different ways to approach the two steps to get varying results. The attempt of this research is to show that different types of dungeon generation can be effective at encouraging different goals for different types of players. A big motivation here is to validate the use of a variety of systems to create varying gameplay experiences. They use three types of algorithms for map generation as well as furnishing, then combine each different type to get clear results, which pretty much amount to exactly what they sought out to show. The different types of generations vary in effectiveness from type of player to type of player. It has several graphs showing the data points for their generations as well as examples of maps that would be generated by their system using each combination. This article is right up my alley since it clearly displays and discusses methods for map generation and what kinds of experiences they each cultivate.
