For this blog post, I’d like to discuss the feasibility of my project as a whole, as well as the resources and time it will take to complete it. The result of my project will be a tool for Unity that one can use to generate level layouts/maps for roguelike games by giving it pre-made geometry with connectors. I already have most of the resources I would need in order to make the program. My PC is able to run Unity very well, so hardware is not a concern, so the only thing I would need as far as resources go would just be my own knowledge of Unity’s systems and C#, as well as how to actually create what I’m attempting to make. That being said, I already have a basic knowledge of how Unity functions, so I should be able to learn these things in a reasonable amount of time before starting my work on the comp. In order to get satisfactory results from this project, I’ll most likely be doing a large amount of testing myself by creating geometry and connectors to test it with, though it could be a good idea to enlist some help from people other than myself in order to get a robust testing of the systems as well as advice on how to improve the user interface, as that is an important part of the application. For the length of this project, I fully believe that I would be able to complete it in the 2-3 months we will be given to work on it, but I feel like I could probably finish it faster if I do a bit of preparatory work to better familiarize myself with Unity and C#. Overall, I feel confident in my ability to complete this work and achieve my goal of making a practical tool to generate maps in Unity.
