I found this article titled [Mixed-Initiative Design of Game Levels: Integrating Mission and Space into Level Generation](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/79239689/fdg2015_paper_25-libre.pdf?1642798522=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DMixed_Initiative_Design_of_Game_Levels_I.pdf&Expires=1675360331&Signature=CapLg8-Hx5EXl0dXmPu-7KrL3HxawtYldkR0sy0~DMUWKTdR0bRA3s0aGyhLnyCfVH-ta0UmEr7q7rM42Zv9M~cc6SBxO8VO6HyIxT-jz1rnd9qjbjF~rM31NU4ZM3r2GxlaoELikvUuv3P1TTXk4NRrn0M889oISFJHzh3Oq~mofwQZR~tcFNdBhn~cA-Ezw5kwMzFCWcmgi53zXf78QA47o1jLDAUkycRVRaei9prMuSeAjJ6dmkuSKYQpCxg2YP7e69vYfjOr~1v1TKou9jFqW-nNUKBXfYqbsuVuDkfmmBQbp0KOybGvv~91fwfahCd4aVDB68ZXUBFPl3yJPA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA). This article closely aligns with my research interest because it discusses how procedural content generation can be made to look more closely at how to match a given mission to a given map. The main discussion point is how most games that use procedural content generation tend to create random missions and random maps separately from each other, which can sometimes lead to clunky feeling objectives since they might not have anything to do with each other. In this way, it’s important to tailor the map generating systems to take advantage of which mission it might be given in order to generate a more fitting map for what the player needs to do so it feels sensible given the player’s objective. It also takes a closer look at different design tools to go about this process in a much more understandable and efficient fashion. A couple of case studies that it uses are based on Roguelike dungeon generation and the generation of platforming levels for a Metroidvania game. This look into content generation with a mixed-initiative design process will prove very useful for my research should I go into the topic of Roguelike gaming for my senior project.
