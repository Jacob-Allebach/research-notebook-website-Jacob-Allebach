## [Procedural Game Level Generation by Joining Geometry with Hand-Placed Connectors](https://recil.ensinolusofona.pt/bitstream/10437/12353/1/Videojogos_2020_Submission_8_cameraready1.pdf)

This article is about map generation by using pre-created geometry and hand place points of connection between different nodes to create a much more intentional-feeling map that players can go through. It connects the map pieces together somewhat like a jigsaw puzzle to form the larger map area. The intended use of the example in the article is for a 3D multiplayer shooter game, which is not the type of game I'd like to try to generate maps for, but the principles of map generation that the article is talking about are still very relevant to what I am trying to do. The concept of hand-placing connectors on pieces of geometry and then using different generation methods to create a larger map with nodes connected is exactly the kind of tool I am trying to create.
